This is a [kiwitrees](http://kiwitrees.net) plugin for displaying location data on openstreetmap tiles, hosted by mapbox, and displayed via leaflet. It is a fork from the webtrees equivalent by oddityoverseer13at https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/webtrees-openstreetmap

Requirements
============
This module requires kiwitrees 3.0.1+.

For now, this module relies on the Google Maps module. In the future, the plan is to remove that requirement.
